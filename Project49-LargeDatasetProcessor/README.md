## Scenario 49: Handling Large Datasets in Memory  
**Problem Statement: Efficiently handling and processing large datasets that do not fit into memory.**

**Detailed Scenario: A Python program needs to process large datasets, such as log files or sensor data, without running out of memory.**

**Usecase Approach: Use Python’s pandas to load data in chunks and process it incrementally.**

**Tools and Modules: pandas**

Approch:  
- Use pandas.read_csv(..., chunksize=...) to avoid memory overload  
- Process each chunk independently (filter, transform, aggregate, etc.)  
- Keep counters or write partial results to disk/database  
- Useful for logs, sensor feeds, and large exports
