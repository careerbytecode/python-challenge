## Scenario 22: Parsing XML Data  
**Problem Statement: The application needs to extract specific elements from XML documents received from external systems for further processing.  

**Detailed Scenario: The system frequently receives XML files, such as configuration data, transaction logs, or user profiles. These files contain structured data with nested tags. The goal is to identify and extract specific elements like <username>, <email>, or <status> so that the relevant data can be logged, transformed, or passed into another system for processing.**  

**Use Case Approach: To achieve this, Python’s xml.etree.ElementTree module can be used to parse the XML content and traverse the document tree. By accessing elements through methods like .find() or .findall(), the script can extract both text content and attribute values. This extracted data can then be printed, validated, or written to an output file such as CSV or JSON for downstream use.**  

**Tools and Modules: xml.etree.ElementTree for parsing and navigating the XML structure. os for managing file paths if processing multiple files. csv or json modules (optional) for structured output.**

Approach:  
- Use Python’s xml.etree.ElementTree to load and parse the XML file.  
- Traverse the XML tree to find specific tags (e.g., <user>, <name>, <email>).  
- Extract the required text or attribute values.  
- Store or print the extracted data in a readable format.
