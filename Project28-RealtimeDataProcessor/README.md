## Scenario 28: Real-Time Data Processing  
**Problem Statement: Processing real-time data streams from external sources.**  

**Detailed Scenario: The application needs to process a continuous stream of real-time data (e.g., stock prices or sensor data) and perform analysis or logging.**  

**Usecase Approach: Use Python’s asyncio or threading to process data in real-time without blocking the application.**  

**Tools and Modules: queue, threading**

Approch:  
- One thread simulates real-time data input (like a sensor)  
- Another thread processes the data (logging, alerting, etc.)  
- A queue.Queue is used to safely share data between threads  
- Runs continuously, but non-blocking

Refrence:  
- threading - to simulate or handle background data collection  
- queue - to safely pass data between threads  
- time, random - for simulation
