### Approach:

- **Understand the API Documentation:**  
    Review the REST API documentation to identify endpoints, request methods, required headers, authentication, and expected responses.

- **Implement API Requests:**  
    Use the `requests` module to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests as needed. Handle parameters, headers, and authentication as specified by the API.

- **Process API Responses:**  
    Check response status codes and parse JSON or other response formats to extract the required data.

- **Organize Code for Reusability:**  
    Structure the client code into functions or classes to make it reusable and maintainable for different API endpoints.
