## Scenario 60: Log Spike Analyzer  
**Problem Statement: Automatically detect unusual spikes in application log error rates and summarize the offending log lines.**  

**Detailed Scenario: In production environments, sudden spikes in error logs can indicate outages, misconfigurations, or cascading failures. Manual inspection wastes precious time and delays resolution.**  

**Use Case Approach: You have application logs being written continuously (e.g., /var/log/app.log). The script will tail the log in real time, parse lines for severity keywords (ERROR, CRITICAL, FAIL), and measure error rates in sliding time windows. If the error rate exceeds a threshold, the script triggers an alert (console, email, or Slack) and writes a summary file of the last N error lines.**

Approach:  
- Use Python’s watchdog or tail -f style streaming to monitor logs in near real time.  
- Maintain a rolling count of errors in a deque for the last X seconds.  
- When a spike threshold is crossed, capture the most recent error entries for quick triage.
